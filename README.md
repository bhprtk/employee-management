### Setup Instructions
1. **Extract the Codebase**:
   - Download the zip file and extract it to your preferred directory.

2. **Import the Project**:
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java IDE).
   - Select **Open** and navigate to the extracted project directory.

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Open a MySQL client or GUI (e.g., MySQL Workbench or the command line).
   - Create the database and import the schema:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE testdb;
     USE testdb;
     SOURCE create_schema.sql;
     ```
   - To populate the database with initial testing data, run:
     ```sql
     SOURCE initialize_data.sql;
     ```
   - Update the database configuration in `UserDAO.java`:
     ```java
     private static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/testdb";
     private static final String DB_USER = "root";
     private static final String DB_PASSWORD = "your_password";
     ```

4. **Configure Tomcat**:
   - In IntelliJ, go to **Run > Edit Configurations**.
   - Add a new **Tomcat Server** configuration.
   - Set the deployment directory to the projectâ€™s `web` folder.

5. **Run the Application**:
   - Start the Tomcat server from IntelliJ.
   - Open a web browser and navigate to:
     ```
     http://localhost:8080/
     ```

## Dependencies and Required Software
- **Java**: Version 11 or above.
- **Jakarta Servlet API**: Version 6.1.0.
- **MySQL Connector/J**: Version 8.0 or above.
- **Bootstrap**: For front-end design (included via CDN).

---

## Additional Configuration Steps
1. **Database Credentials**:
   - Ensure that the `DB_URL`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASSWORD` in `UserDAO.java` match your MySQL setup.
   - Grant necessary privileges to the database user:
     ```sql
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON testdb.* TO 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
     FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
     ```

2. **Port Configuration**:
   - If Tomcat is running on a port other than `8080`, update the URL accordingly.

3. **Optional Testing Data**:
   - Use the provided sample SQL queries to populate the `employees` and `attendance` tables with additional data for testing:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO employees (firstname, lastname, username, email, password, role) VALUES
     ('John', 'Doe', 'johndoe', 'john.doe@example.com', 'hashed_password', 'employee');
     ```
